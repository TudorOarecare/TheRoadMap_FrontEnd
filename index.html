    <title>Front-End Developer Roadmap 2020</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
  <h1>The plan</h1>
  <p>This guide will be very focused on minimalism: doing less, not more.</p>
  <p>Outline:</p>
  <h2>Why you should become a front-end developer in 2020</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Salary</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This is a profession that is very well paid and you won't have to worry
        about money.
      </li>
      <li>
        You shouldn't do it just for the sake of money, because you're not going
        to make it because web development is hard. If you go for the money 99%
        of the times you will fail. You're not patient enough, you're not
        resilient enough so the probability of success is very, very low.
        SOLUTION: Learn through trial and error, the lighbulb will go off.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Solving problems</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Not only are you solving problems but you can do it creatively.</li>
      <li>
        More fun than pure back-end since you get to work on many different
        aspects of the product
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Design</li>
        <li>Performance</li>
        <li>Code</li>
        <li>Colors</li>
        <li>Typography</li>
        <li>UX</li>
        <li>Serverless</li>
        <li>Hot new tools</li>
        <li>Different frameworks</li>
        <li>You even need to interact with the client/customer.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        A lot of what used to be done by "pure" back-end developers can be done
        by front-end developers today.
      </li>
      <li>Career opportunities</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Exponential room for growth</li>
        <li>
          Much easier to get into because to learn back-end you have to start
          with front-end first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Harder to master because there are so many new tools, you have so many
          different variables, which results in more complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's always going to be chaotic and newbies have an advantage. You can
          start today and go in hard and learn and be actually hireable in the
          marketplace. If a developer starts learning today he/she will be
          obsolete in 2-3 years because things are changing so rapidly.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is probably the worst time to become a web developer in terms of
          difficulty because today there's a lot of tools, ways, frameworks,
          languages, paradigms to do things for front-end and things are
          changing so rapidly.
        </li>
        <li>
          This also makes it the best time to get into the field if you're
          willing to put in the hard work and invest into it 100% because the
          payoffs are so well worth it.
        </li>
        <li>
          There's always going to be high demand for good front-end developers
          because there's always going to be chaos. Developers become obsolete
          if they don't stay in the game for a few years.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2>Computer science</h2>
  <p>Estimated time required: 50 hrs</p>
  <p>
    It's highly recommended to start learning computer science and not jump
    right into web development. You're going to feel like you're going slow but
    you're actually going fast.
